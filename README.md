In these instructions the first character `$` in the command examples should not be typed, but it denotes the command prompt.

Some command lines are too long to fit a line in printed form. These are indicated by a backslash `\` at the end of line. It should not be included when typing in the command. For example : 

```
$ example command \
continues \
and continues
```
Should be typed in as:

```
example command continues and continues
```
